### VS Code Users
This repository comes with a .vscode settings submodule where several extensions
are recommended to improve the community development experience. The settings
include usage of a font which renders with ligatures. If you do not install
this font, the editor will render text in the default system font.  Please
check out [our guide](https://github.com/iteam-consulting/vsc-settings-web)
for more information.
